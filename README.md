## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing census data from the United States to explore relationships between various demographic factors and income levels. The goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on the given demographic data.

## Project Objective
The objective is to apply four machine learning classifiers to the dataset to predict the income column. The classifiers used are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbours (KNN). The aim is to identify the most important features affecting income and to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy.

## Data Pre-processing
- Data Cleaning: Null values were removed from the dataset.
- Feature Selection: The fnlwgt column was dropped, and ordinal encoding was applied to nominal and ordinal columns.
- Normalization: The input data was normalized using MinMaxScaler.

## Machine Learning Models
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- K-nearest Neighbours (KNN)

## Key Insights
- The three most important features impacting income were identified (although not specified in the provided text).
- All classifiers were trained and evaluated, with their confusion matrices plotted for better understanding of their performance.

## Conclusion
The project successfully applied multiple machine learning classifiers to predict income levels based on demographic data. The analysis identified key features impacting income and provided insights into the performance of different classifiers, guiding future improvements for higher accuracy.
